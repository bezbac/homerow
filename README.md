## Download

Download Homerow and view the changelog [here](https://homerow.app/download/).

Requires macOS 12.3 or later.

## User Guide

This is Homerow's workflow:
1. Activate via shortcut (default is `Command-Shift-Space`)
2. Search for the UI element to click on
3. Targets will show for the UI elements matching the query. The green target is the current focused target.
4. Press `Tab` or `Arrow-Dn` until the correct UI element is focused
5. Press `Enter` to perform a click on the UI element

### Queries

1. Spaces and cases are ignored
2. `*` will query for all UI elements

### Not sure what to type? The Tutor ðŸ¤“ comes to the rescue!

Press `Command-T` to toggle The Tutor. Hover the cursor over the UI element to learn about itâ€™s searchable properties.

### Controls

| Action  | Binding(s) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Focus next UI element | `Tab`, `Arrow Dn`, or `Control-N` |
| Focus previous UI element | `Shift-Tab`, `Arrow Up`, or `Control-P` |
| Left-click | `Enter` |
| Right-click | `Shift-Enter` |
| Command-click (performs `Open Link in New Tab`) | `Command-Enter` |
| Toggle `The Tutor ðŸ¤“` | `Command-T` |
| Exit | `Esc` |

### Pro-tip: Map Caps Lock to Hyper Key

You'll likely activate Homerow quite frequently, so make the controls as comfortable and as quick as possible for the best experience.

Three reasons to use Hyper Key:
1. Activate Homerow with `Caps Lock + F`
2. Focus the next or previous UI Element with `Caps Lock + J` and `Caps Lock + K` respectively.
3. Navigate menus with `Caps Lock + H/J/K/L`

How to set up Hyper Key:
1. [Hyperkey](https://hyperkey.app) by Ryan Hanson OR
2. Configure Karabiner-Elements
