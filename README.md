# Homerow

Like Raycast or Spotlight for macOS. Click, navigate, and perform tasks with the keyboard and no mouse.

## User Guide

This is Homerow's workflow:
1. Activate via shortcut (default is `Command-Shift-Space`)
2. Search for the UI element to click on
3. Targets will show for the UI elements matching the query. The green target is the current focused target.
4. Press `Tab` or `Arrow-Dn` until the correct UI element is focused
5. Press `Enter` to perform a click on the UI element

### Queries

1. Spaces and cases are ignored
2. `*` will query for all UI elements

### Not sure what to type? The Tutor ðŸ¤“ comes to the rescue!

Press `Command-T` to toggle The Tutor. Hover the cursor over the UI element to learn about itâ€™s searchable properties.
